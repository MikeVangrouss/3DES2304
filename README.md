# 3DES2304 Cipher
Triple DES 2304 bits Encryption Cipher

The Triple DES uses three 56-bit (i.e. 168-bit) keys. However, the internal keys are much larger. The Triple DES uses the three 56-bit keys to generate 3 * 16 48-bit subkeys, i.e. 2304 bits. 

The 168-bit limitation of the key is artificial, so it can be enlarged up to 2304 bits. In 2014 the Triple DES-2304 was released, it uses the same principle as the Triple DES but the 3 * 16 subkeys are generated by a one-way hash function. 

The result is an algorithm that works at the same speed as the Triple DES but with a 2304-bit key. Note that weak keys do not exist in Triple DES-2304 since subkeys are generated by a one-way hash function.
